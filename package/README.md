# Vince's Svelte Context Menu

A simple, no-frills context menu that works out of the box with Bootstrap but allows total customization. This context menu can be set up to work with `on:click` and `on:contextmenu`.

By default, the context menu will appear to the bottom and right of where a click occurred. However, it automatically repositions itself if it overflows.
